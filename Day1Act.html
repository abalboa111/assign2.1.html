                    Educator. Born on September 30 in Manila, Philippines to Ofelia Balboa and Rodolfo Balboa Sr. Since he was five years old, he already dreamed of becoming a teacher. He was raised from a less-privileged family but poverty did not become a hindrance to achieve his burning passion to inspire young minds, instead it became a fuel that helped to ignite his desire to educate people.

After finishing his degree in the year 1999, his dream became a reality by becoming a teacher in the Basic Education Department of Manila Central University for one and a half years.
